Sensor Observation Service (SOS) and data management for Air Quality data from RIVM The Netherlands.
In this project Air Quality data provided by Het Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM)
is harvested and converted for further dispatching via the OGC SOS INSPIRE-enabled web-service and
other standards like WMS/WFS and E-reporting for Shared Environmental Information System (SEISs) like
the EU Shared Environmental Information System for reporting ambient air quality (2011/850/EU). 

The [SOSPilot website](http://sensors.geonovum.nl) is a landing page for docs, viewers, services and more.
All documentation can be found at: [sospilot.readthedocs.org](http://sospilot.readthedocs.org)

In september 2015 support for Air Quality, Meteo and Audio data for 
the [Smart Emission project](http://smartemission.nl)
was added. Read also about this project in a dedicated chapter in the 
documentation: [sospilot.readthedocs.org/en/latest/smartemission.html](http://sospilot.readthedocs.org/en/latest/smartemission.html)

The Smart Emission project now has a GitHub repo of its own at
[github.com/Geonovum/smartemission](https://github.com/Geonovum/smartemission). In time all SE-resources
will move there.
